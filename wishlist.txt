What is a Wishlist feature?

A Wishlist lets users:

⭐ Save products they like

🕒 Buy later

🔁 Track price drops / stock updates

❤️ Personalize their shopping experience

Core behavior (from user side)

Click ❤️ Save / Wishlist

Product gets stored in their account

View all saved products in My Wishlist

Remove anytime

How it works (backend logic – high level)
1️⃣ Database Design

You have two clean options:

Option A (Best & simple)

Wishlist collection

userId

products[] (productId)

createdAt

➡️ One wishlist per user

Option B

Add wishlist: [productId] inside User schema

➡️ Simpler, but grows with user activity

✅ For production: Option A is cleaner

2️⃣ API Flow

Typical endpoints:

POST /wishlist/add

DELETE /wishlist/remove/:productId

GET /wishlist

Logic:

Check if user is logged in

Check if product already saved

Toggle add/remove

Return updated wishlist

3️⃣ Frontend Flow (React idea)

Heart icon ❤️ on product card

If saved → filled heart

If not → outline heart

Click → call API

Update UI instantly (optimistic update)

4️⃣ Extra smart features (🔥 impressive)

You can add:

🔔 Notify when price drops

⏳ Move to cart

❌ Auto-remove out-of-stock items

📊 Wishlist count badge

🧠 Use wishlist for recommendations

5️⃣ Performance tips

Cache wishlist in Redis

Store only productId, fetch details via populate

Index on userId
